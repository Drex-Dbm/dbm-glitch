the only things needed are for you to do this

Then on uptimerobot
Create an account with them (very fast signup)
and then login if it doesn't already.

Click Add New Monitor 
For monitor type, select Http's
For the URL: put in your-project-name-here.glitch.me
Then click on create monitor and then move onto the next steps

Then exit the glitch page to make sure the uptimerobot and the script does it's job!



Please be sure to remix it and then make it private 
to keep everything safe
