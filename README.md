the only things needed are for you to do this

Know how to add your own commands/events
if you dont know 
make sure you have a text editor 
go to your bots folder hit data and then right click on commands.json/events.json
copy its insides and go to glitch scroll to the bottom until you see the commands.json or events.json file and paste them there 

then

Then on uptimerobot
Create an account with them (very fast signup)
and then login if it doesn't already.

Click Add New Monitor 
For monitor type, select Http's
For the URL: put in your-project-name-here.glitch.me
Then click on create monitor and then move onto the next steps

Then exit the glitch page to make sure the uptimerobot and the script does it's job!



Please be sure to remix it and then make it private 
to keep everything safe
